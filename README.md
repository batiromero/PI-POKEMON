## Project Objectives

I've really enjoy coding this Single Page Application using React, Redux, Node, PostgreSQL & Sequelize.
The general idea was to create an application in which you can see the different Pokemon Trading Cards using the external api [pokeapi] (https://pokeapi.co/) and from it can:

   - Search pokemons by origin (API & Created by user)
   - Filter / Sort them (By Attack & Alphabetically)
   - Create new Pokemons
